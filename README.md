# EDA Civil Engineering Concrete Dataset 
==============================

### An Exploratory Analysis of the characteristic properties of Concrete Using a Civil Engineering Dataset. 

## Introduction
The primary incentive of this research is to utilize various techniques from Data Analysis and Feature Engineering 
concepts in order to acquire more readable and useable data that can be applied to various Machine Learning models 
in the future to improve performance and add more convenience to the field of Civil Engineering.
